            <p class="description_header">OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS</p>
            <p class="description_details">
                Our premier product is recharge cards (all networks) which, from our research is the most frequent and widely used product, globally.
                It is quite surprising how Telecoms have grown in contrast to a decade ago. In 2005, the Nigerian telecommunication sector had over 19 million subscribers. 
                But at the end of 2016, it has grown to a total of 154 million. The drop in the cost of sim cards and advent of smart phones are the major reasons for this rapid 
                growth as people can now do business 'on the goâ€™
